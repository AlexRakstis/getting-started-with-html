<h1>Some Important Concepts</h1>

<b>How the Interweb Interconnects</b>
<p>The the world wide web is a lot of interconnected computers. When a you click a <a href="www.imgur.com"> link </a> <em> such as www.imgur.com</em>, your computer sends an <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em> in a datacenter somewhere in serverland.
  The server locates the requested HTML document and transmits it back to the your computer where your <em>web browser</em> interprets the page and displays it on your monitor for your viewing plaesure.

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML = <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML documents create the most of the content on the interweb. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes what you view on the web page and <em>markup</em> which tranlates how it looks in your
  browser.

<b>Why Computers Are Instriniscally Stupid</b>
<p>Computers are only a smart as the programmer that programs them. They translate input in a very literal fashion. This means that a small input error by an the person coding can cause a progrom to completely fail.
</p>
<br>
<b>Inline Elemets vs. Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML <em><b>inline</b></em> elements are a line or line to line code.
  <br> HTML <em><b>block</b></em> create an "invisible box" around the content inside of the box.
